      "severity": "High",
      "target_software": "Ghost CMS < 5.42.1 (active theme assets endpoint)",
      "attack_vector": "Network",
      "impact_description": "Unauthenticated attackers can read arbitrary files reachable via the active theme's assets path resolution. This may expose configuration files, environment variables, logs, and other sensitive files, aiding credential theft, service discovery, and further compromise. In many deployments the intended read scope is within the active theme directory, but incorrect canonicalization and decoding can allow traversal to higher-level directories depending on server configuration.",

        "endpoint": "GET /assets/built/<user-controlled path>",
        "vulnerability_cause": "Improper canonicalization and validation of path components in the assets handler for active theme files. '../' sequences and encoded variants are not properly rejected before filesystem access.",
