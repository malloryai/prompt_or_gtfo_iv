title: 'Webserver: Successful file-read response from /assets/built/ with indicators
  of sensitive files (package.json, .env, docker-compose)'

status: test
description: Detect responses to requests under /assets/built/ that return HTTP 200
  and response bodies containing markers indicating sensitive files (e.g., "dependencies",
  "DATABASE_URL", "docker-compose"). These responses may indicate a successful directory
  traversal and disclosure of configuration or secrets (CVE-2023-32235).

falsepositives: Some legitimate JSON assets might contain generic keys like "name"
  or "version". Reduce false positives by correlating with traversal payloads or unexpected
  content-type (e.g., application/json for an asset expected to be JS/CSS).
