      "content": "Overall risk assessment: High\n\nKey findings\n- URLScan.io\n  - Attempted twice; retrieval failed with error: \u201cFailed to retrieve URLScan results: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\u201d. This could be a transient service issue, rate limit, or the site blocking headless scanners. No page or network artifacts were obtained via URLScan for this run.\n- VirusTotal\n  - Detection ratio: 2/97 engines flagged the URL as malicious/suspicious\n  - Scan date: 2025-08-14 16:28:40 UTC\n  - Permalink: https://www.virustotal.com/gui/url/aHR0cHM6Ly9pYi1yZXRhaWxkYnMuY29t/detection\n  - Interpretation: While only a small subset of engines detect it, any positive flags on a likely banking-related URL warrant caution.\n\nSpecific threats or suspicious indicators\n- Brand impersonation/typosquatting indicators:\n  - The domain \u201cib-retaildbs.com\u201d strongly suggests \u201cIB\u201d (Internet Banking) + \u201cretail\u201d + \u201cDBS,\u201d which aligns with DBS Bank branding. Official DBS properties are typically under dbs.com or dbs.com.sg. This naming pattern is commonly used for phishing pages targeting banking credentials.\n- Low-but-nonzero AV consensus:\n  - 2 vendors identifying the URL increases the likelihood of phishing or malicious content, even if consensus is not yet broad. Such detections often precede wider industry recognition.\n- Potential cloaking or scanner evasion:\n  - URLScan retrieval issues can sometimes indicate that the site blocks automated scanners or serves different content to headless browsers, a common tactic on phishing sites.\n\nRecommended actions\n- Immediate protective controls\n  - Block the domain and all subdomains at the DNS resolver, secure web gateway, email gateway, and endpoint URL filtering.\n  - If you administer mail defenses, add URL rewriting/defang rules and quarantine messages containing this domain.\n- User and incident response\n  - Notify end users (especially those in APAC/finance roles) to avoid the site; explain it likely imitates DBS Bank internet banking.\n  - If any user visited the URL and entered credentials, immediately reset the affected banking and corporate passwords, enable/verify MFA, and monitor accounts for fraudulent activity.\n  - Hunt in logs for any traffic to:\n    - Domain: ib-retaildbs.com\n    - Full URL: https://ib-retaildbs.com\n    - Create a retro-hunt for similarly patterned domains: /(ib[-.]?retail.*dbs|dbs.*retail.*ib)/i\n- Further validation and evidence collection\n  - Re-run URLScan later or with an API key; capture screenshots, DOM, and request chain. Consider alternate headless user agents to bypass basic bot blocking.\n  - Perform a controlled dynamic analysis in an isolated sandbox to observe landing content, form posts, redirections, and any script-loaded resources.\n  - Check certificate transparency logs and WHOIS for domain age, registrar, and hosting ASN to strengthen takedown requests.\n- External actions\n  - Report suspected phishing to the registrar/host, APWG/PhishTank, and DBS Bank\u2019s abuse/security contacts for potential takedown.\n\nTechnical details summary\n- URL: https://ib-retaildbs.com\n- URLScan.io: No results retrieved. Error: \u201cFailed to retrieve URLScan results: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\u201d\n- VirusTotal result:\n  - Detection ratio: 2/97\n  - Scan date/time: 2025-08-14 16:28:40 UTC\n  - Permalink: https://www.virustotal.com/gui/url/aHR0cHM6Ly9pYi1yZXRhaWxkYnMuY29t/detection\n\nNotes/assumptions\n- The risk rating is elevated due to the strong brand-impersonation signal combined with nonzero AV detections and potential scanner evasion. If subsequent manual analysis proves the site is benign and owned by DBS (unlikely given the domain), controls can be revised accordingly.",
