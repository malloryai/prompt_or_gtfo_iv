Input: the attacker bypassed auth using a path traversal vulnerability
------------------------------
Analysis Summary: The input describes an authentication bypass achieved via a path traversal flaw. Within the provided technique list, the best fit is T1556 (Modify Authentication Process) to capture the effect of subverting auth. Potential but speculative alternatives include T1550.004 or T1606.001 if the bypass hinged on stolen/forged web session cookies.
Number of mappings found: 1

Mapping 1:
  Technique: T1556 - Modify Authentication Process
  Confidence: 0.45
  Rationale: The phrase "bypassed auth" indicates the adversary subverted the authentication mechanism. While the method cited is a path traversal vulnerability (an exploitation detail not represented directly in the provided technique set), the outcome aligns with Modify Authentication Process (T1556) as the attacker avoided normal authentication controls. If the bypass involved leveraging or crafting session material (e.g., accessing/using a session cookie or token via path traversal), then Use Alternate Authentication Material: Web Session Cookie (T1550.004) or Forge Web Credentials: Web Cookies (T1606.001) could also apply, though this is not explicit in the input.
  Alternatives: 2 other subtechniques
